    <h1 id="aboutMe"> Why did I join Code Nation?</h1>

    <p>I always liked computer-based technologies and appreciated their impact on the modern business and peoples' lives. In the past, I worked as a technical developer in the financial sector for five years. My main programming languages were Statistical Analysis Software (SAS), SQL and basic HTML. After that role I spent several years pursuing a different career path. Now I became interested in programming again and would like to learn up-to-date techniques for software development. This is why I believe this crash course "Develop: Coding", provided by <a href="https://wearecodenation.com" >Code Nation</a> in Manchester, will suit my needs well.</p>
    <h1 id="assignment1"> Improving productivity with IT - Assignment 1</h1>
        
    <h3>1.1 The purpose of IT in modern business</h3>

    <p> Information technology has become a vital and integral part of every business. From multi-national corporations who maintain mainframe systems and databases to small businesses that own a single computer, the diferrent roles of IT are: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Communication. For many companies, email is the principal means of communication between employees, suppliers and customers. Over the years, a number of other communications tools have been developed, e.g. live chat systems, online meeting tools and video-conferencing systems etc.</li>
            <li>Inventory management systems track the quantity of each item a company maintains, triggering an order of additional stock when the quantities fall below a predetermined amount.</li>
            <li>Data Management. Companies are able to store and maintain a tremendous amount of historical data economically, and employees benefit from immediate access to the documents they need.</li>
            <li>Management Information Systems enable companies to track sales data, expenses and productivity levels. Managers can track sales on a daily basis, allowing them to immediately react to lower-than-expected numbers by boosting employee productivity or reducing the cost of an item.</li>
            <li>Customer Relationship Management systems capture every interaction a company has with a customer, so that a more enriching experience is possible. It helps to improve the way they design and manage customer relationships.</li>
        </ol>
    <p>Due to the latest technological advances, businesses have greater options for effective communication, ways to increase productivity as well as to save business costs by automating business operations and processes. In these days, organizations and companies are using computers, latest software & apps, high speed internet and IoT for transforming their businesses from local markets to international market with an intention to compete giant competitors in the industry from all around the world. Companies and businesses are increasingly shifting to automation due to availability of latest business software and apps.Technological advances are playing a vital role in reducing business costs and expenses. Most of companies and organisations are also using their own networks to make increase the business mobility as well as to let their employees work from home or any other location. </p>
    
    <h3> 1.2 Methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully.</h3>

    <p>The project must have deadline and the schedule detailing each specific task and step with its clear completion timescales. The project team with appropriate skils and expertise must be selected and assigned to differnt tasks.</p>
    <p> It is essentual that you manage to keep the project within the scope, on budget, and on time. Most digital projects go through the following steps: Scoping, Planning, Development, Testing & Deployment, Maintenance. Depending on the team and type of project, one should choose the right project management methodology and tools, which might include: Agile Scrum, Trello, Forecast, etc. For my project, I used <a href="https://trello.com/b/MTGDrAzl/my-blog"> Trello.</a></p>
   
    <h3>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT </h3>

    <p>While working on this project, I used Agile Project Management approach -  breaking a requirement into smaller pieces, then prioritising them in terms of importance, for each piece I consistently updated my Trello board cards which helped me to stay on track and monitor my progress. Here is the link to <a href="https://trello.com/b/MTGDrAzl/my-blog"> my Trello board</a> detailing my planning and progress.</p>
    <p>I have planned the assignment by creating a card for each task, applying Kanban methodology. I researched the internet for information, attached links to URLs and typed text into comments in each card.</p>
    <p>I discussed my understanding of required features with classmates and instructors.</p>
        
    <h3>1.4 The risks that might impact digital projects</h3>

    <p>As with most aspects of business, digital projects rarely happen under ideal circumstances. They can require a broad convergence of people, systems and data. Despite your best efforts, it’s not always possible to have ironclad answers to every question from the outset.</p>
    <p>Some possible risks in a digital project are: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>dependence on commercial software with its updates and possible errors;</li>
            <li>competitors might undercut your product;</li>   
             li>key personnel might leave.</li>
        </ul> 
    <p>The landscape of the digital world can change quickly and unexpectedly. When the planning process recognises the potential for change and allows for contingency planning, the probability of project success increases dramatically. This means you have to identify and plan for potential risks as much as possible.</p>
   
    <h3>1.5 Selecting and using  the right kind of IT systems and software </h3>
    <p>Technology helps to do things better, faster, or more efficiently. The decision on the website development platform depends on the site’s functionality, construction and maintenance costs, the databases it uses, and the servers that host the site. It is also important to consider the skill set of the team that will be in charge of ongoing troubleshooting and maintenance after the site is launched.</p> 
    <p>The most popular development platforms are: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>PHP (PHP Hypertext Preprocessor is a scripting language that is embedded into HTML pages)</li>
            <li>.NET (is a proprietary Microsoft platform designed for developing web applications, ASP.NET code must be compiled (converted into an executable file) in order to utilize it in your website, the compiled code performs faster and is more secure since you cannot see the source code embedded in the HTML),</li>
            <li>JSP (is a web development platform introduced by Sun Microsystems it is a server-side technology, meaning that the code is first compiled and then executed as an application by the web server).</li>
        </ul>  
    <p>For my assignment, I used the tools which I learned on this course: HTML, CSS, Visual Studio Code.</p>

    <h3>1.6 How has Trello, Git and GitHub helped me to achieve the outcomes</h3>

    <p>Git is an open-source version control system. Throughout the process of developing the code keeps changing.</p>
    <p>Version control systems keep these changes straight, storing the modifications in a central repository. This allows developers to easily collaborate, as they can download a new version of the software, make changes, and upload the newest revision. Every developer can see these new changes, download them, and contribute.</p>       
    <p>GitHub.com allows developers to store their projects and to network with like-minded people. </p>
    <p>The social networking aspect of GitHub is probably its most powerful feature, allowing projects to grow more than just about any of the other features offered. Each user on GitHub has their own profile that acts like a resume of sorts, showing your past work and contributions to other projects via pull requests.</p>
    <p>GitHub takes care of multiple people collaboration on a projectby keeping track of all the changes that have been pushed to the repository. It was introduced to me in this course. I found it to be an excellent platform for handling versions of files and accessibility.</p>
    <p>Trello is a great project management tool to organise the work of a whole team or just to boost your own productivity.</p> 
    <p>It is also location-agnostic: it doesn’t matter if your teammates are at the next desk or across the world. </p>   
    <p>I have used Trello to follow my production workflow and to manage my development schedule. My dedicated board shows me what needs to be done, the status of all tasks, and where potential bottlenecks are. Trello is well-suited for agile methods. It’s great for prioritising urgent and important tasks and it works for time blocking.</p>
    <p>I have found that the app’s design stores a lot of information in a highly organised, clean space. Its simplicity belies a huge amount of power. 
    <p> I have created Trello workflow  - Lists, as the classifiers of my activities within a Board. I have used the classical Kanban approach of Trello, grouping tasks by the classifying criteria and by subject area in my 'done' lists, creating the following lists: to-do, in-progress and done. Each Trello Card represents a single task in my workflow. Cards are super flexible and they allow to include descriptions, attachments, subtasks or checklists, due dates and times, assignees, and labels. I have uploaded images and files from a Mac book, it is also possible to upload from Google Drive, Dropbox or OneDrive. And with a simple click-and-drag, cards can be moved from one list to another. </p>
    <p> Trello’s power-ups allow to connect applications like Slack, Github, and others straight to its cards.</p>

    <h3>1.7 Legal guidelines (GDPR) and constraints that impact digital projects.</h3>

    <p>Web Sites must conform to current legislation.</p>
    <p>There are currently many legal requirements which must be adhered to if you own or run an online business. For limited companies you need to show your registered address, company number, email address and phone number. You need to have a warning on your website to say that you are using cookies. There are some extra laws that apply if you are selling through an e-commerce website. The General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR for short, is a new EU law regulating data privacy, specifically aimed at improving the privacy of EU citizens and make companies more transparent in how they deal with data. As outlined in Article 6, at least one of the below must apply in order for personal data to be processed:
    </p> 
    <div>
    <ol>  
        <li>Consent: Clear and unambiguous consent had to be given for an individual’s personal data to be processed.</li>
        <li>Contract: the data is necessary to fulfill your contractual obligations to them they have asked you to do something before entering into a contract and you cannot comply without processing their personal data.
        </li>
        <li>Legal obligation: data needs to be processed for you to comply with a common law or statutory obligation (not applicable to contractual obligations).</li>
        <li>Vital interests: data needs to be processed to protect someone’s life. You can only rely on vital interests for health data.</li>
        <li>Public task: the processing is necessary in ’the exercise of official authority’.</li>
        <li>Legitimate interest: the legitimate interest can be your own interests, or the interests of third parties. Legitimate interest is more flexible than the other legal grounds and could potentially cover any data processing for any reasonable purpose. However, the processing must be necessary and must not override an individual’s rights.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Organisations that fail to achieve compliance and incur a data breach resulting in the loss of personal data will face enormous penalties </p>

<h3>1.5 Copyright and other constraints affecting websites </h3>

<p>Website legal requirements change frequently, and ignorance is no excuse for ensuring your business complies with all the legal issues and statutory requirements that govern the content and functionality of your website.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The identity of your business. The Companies Act 2006 requires you disclose certain information about the identity of your company on your website.</li>
        <li>The right of users to grant consent for the use of their data. The GDPR regulations came into effect in May 2018. It is one of the most significant pieces of legislation improving the rights of individuals to understand how their personal data is being processed.</li>
        <li>Your company policies and procedures (privacy policy, cookie disclosure, etc.).</li>
        <li>Consumer protection (online and distance selling regulations, e-commerce regulations, consumer rights, costs, payment terms, delivery arrangements, and the rights to cancel).</li>
        <li>Accessibility. Webpages must meet level AA of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1) as a minimum (including screen magnifiers, screen readers and speech recognition tools).</li>
        <li>Cyber security and protecting personal data (a set of technical security processes to prevent hacking and cybercrime). This includes implementing an SSL certificate on your website for the encryption of personal data.</li>
        <li>Copyright protects your work and stops others from using it without your permission.Copyright and other intellectual property laws affect websites because it may restrict what you are able to publish. The best way to get around this is first, get permission from the original author, second, if you want to publish information on your site from another site, link to it and perhaps get permission to publish an excerpt from the original site.</li>
    </ol> 
<p>You get copyright protection automatically - you don’t have to apply or pay a fee. There isn’t a register of copyright works in the UK. Copyright does not last forever and will expire after a certain period of time. It is illegal to share copyrighted material on the internet without the copyright owner’s permission. If you create a piece of work for your employer, the copyright usually belongs to them.</p>
<p>Software is covered by copyright. It prevents:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>copies being made and given to friends and family for free, or being sold for profit;</li>
        <li>using software on a network, where multiple users can access it (unless the licence permits it);</li>
        <li>lending the software to friends or family.</li>
    </ul>
<p>Some copyright owners allow their work to be copied and distributed for educational use or for non-profitable use. Creative Commons licences refine copyright. They allow the copyright owner to say exactly what other people can and can’t do with or to their work. For example, a Creative Commons licence might say that other people can copy and distribute the copyright owner’s work, if they give them credit.</p>

<h3>1.6 Access issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages</h3>

<p>The Web must be accessible to provide equal access and equal opportunity to people with diverse abilities. The following tools can be implemented to assist people with disabilities: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Alternative Text for Images. Iimages should include equivalent alternative text in the markup/code. If alt text isn't provided for images, the image information is inaccessible, for example, to people who cannot see and use a screen reader that reads aloud the information on a page, including the alt text for the visual image.</li>
        <li>Keyboard Input. Some people cannot use a mouse, including many older users with limited fine motor control. An accessible website does not rely on the mouse; it makes all functionality available from a keyboard. Then people with disabilities can use assistive technologies that mimic the keyboard, such as speech input.</li>
        <li>Transcripts for Audio. Providing a text transcript makes the audio information accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing, as well as to search engines and other technologies that can't hear.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>1.7 Appropriate filetypes for websites</h3>

<p>There the three most important classic formats for web images.</p>
<p>GIF supports lossless compression and allows lightweight animation with universal use.</p>
<p>JPEG was developed to support digital photography workflows. It easily delivers a reduction of file weight by a factor of 10 with barely noticeable artifacts, compared to lossless compression.</p>
<p>PNG is a lossless graphics format. Compared to GIF, it delivers much higher quality with usually far fewer bytes.</p>
<p>Newcomers with partial support: WEBP and HEIC based on HEVC. These new formats offer larger feature sets than JPEG and promise relevant savings in file weight with improved visual quality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>WEBP. Google developed this format with the aim to provide a single web-capable image format to deal with all the typical use cases. In principle, it should serve as a replacement for JPEG, PNG, and GIF. An important drawback has been the lack of universal support. Until recently, WebP had been restricted to Google-backed software like the Chrome browser and Android-native applications. However, with the announcement that Edge and Firefox (excluding iOS Firefox) are to introduce WebP support in 2019, it’s evidently gaining traction. It’s also worth noting that Apple — Safari and iOS — does not support WebP yet.</li>
        <li>HEIC/HEIF. This format brings a significant evolution in two different regards. Firstly, the file container supports the largest feature set among image formats available. It supports, for instance, multi-frame images with multi-frame compression — a key feature for efficient HDR, multi-focus, or multi-view images. Secondly, it supports many types of non-image data with a remarkable flexibility. It achieves a much higher compression efficiency at the cost of slightly higher coding times — not a problem at all in web workflows.</li>
    </ul>
<p>Here is a list of commonly used file types in websites:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>.AVI — Audio/Video Interleaved. Standard video format supported on the windows platform.</li>
        <li>.CSS — Cascading StyleSheet. CSS files are a tool in the repertoire of webmasters that take care of how their websites look.</li>
        <li>.DOC — Microsoft Word DOCument. Microsoft Word is the most popular word processing software in the world.</li>
        <li>.EXE — EXEcutable file. If you download a program that you need to install, it will likely come as an exe file.</li>
        <li>.HTML/ .HTM — HyperText Markup Language file. Most pages you create for a website will be HTML files.</li>
        <li>.MIDI/ .MID — Musical Instrument Digital Interface. Midis are sequenced music files made on keyboards.</li>
        <li>.MP3 — MPEG Layer 3 sound file.</li>
        <li>.MPEG/ .MPG — Motion Picture Experts Group file. One of the standards for streaming movies.</li>
        <li>.MOV/ .QT — QuickTime MOVie. The QuickTime format was designed by Apple and originated on the Mac.</li>
        <li>.ODS extensions can be used in open source editor programs such as OpenOffice</li>
        <li>.PDF — Portable Document Format. Adobe Acrobat files were invented so that documents could be transferred between computers and indeed platforms, and still look the exact same, something which can’t be said about HTML files.</li>
        <li>.PPT and .PPTX standard formats for Microsoft powerpoint</li>
        <li>.RAR — RAR archive. This is a compressed file format similar to the popular .zip format.</li>
        <li>.TIFF — Tagged Image File Format. For really high quality images, TIFFs are used, but cannot be viewed through a browser.</li>
        <li>.TXT — TeXT file. The most basic of files, it’s just some text. </li>
        <li>.XLS and .XLSX standard file formats for more modern versions of excel</li>
        <li>.WAV — WAVe sound file. A basic, either un- or not very- compressed sound file, usually used for short sound samples.</li>
        <li>.ZIP — ZIPped file. Zipped files are really groups of other types of files kept together and compressed a bit. Many downloads will consist of zip collections.</li>
    </ul>

<h1 id="review"> Review of outcomes</h1>
    <p>All the tools that I mentioned above were utilised in the process of creating this blog. Even though I met Trello and Visual Studio Code for the first time, I found them very natural and helpful, and mastered their use to a good measure. There was no time to try CodePen but I would definitely like to use it in the future.</p>
    <p>From my limited experience, Visual Studio Code and Trello are fit for the purpose of this project. I am aware of other management tools and software development platforms, e.g. CodePen and Jira, which I am planning to play with in my near future.</p>
    <p>Overall I am quite happy with the end result and thoroughly enjoyed the process of planning , developing and testing my website. I my humble view the following are</p>
        <ul>
            <li> The strengths: </li>
            <li>the website-blog is a finished piece of work within the timescales and the given scope;</li>
            <li>the content and design are original;</li>
            <li>the top navigation bar is functional:</li>
            <li>the photo image is taken and edited by me;</li>
            <li>the simplicity of the layout, page blocks, fonts, background colour, lists, hyperlinks are included.</li>
            <li>Some weaknesses:</li>
            <li>only a single long page with a lot of plain text;</li>
            <li>design slightly boring and could be improved.</li>
    </ul> 
<p>I believe that, given the limited time and steep learning curve, it would be next to impossible to create something very much better. Improvements are certainly possible and desirable, and I am keen on carrying working on this blog after the end of the course.</p>
<p>What I am eager to change: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>introduce more pages and table/ navigation bar of content;</li>
        <li>split the text into different boxes/blocks with corresponding background colours;</li>
        <li>develop more attractive design,</li>
        <li>include more appropriate images with hyperlinks assigned</li>
        <li>create more user-friendly navigation;</li>
        <li>add link to my GitHub repo.</li>
    </ul>
<p>I checked that my website-blog in compatible with the following browsers: Google Chrome, Safari, IE. Thus, users of different platforms will be able to read it. I would also like to add the responsive design to the CSS code and check it works on smaller displays.</p>
<p>If it were a team project, the tasks would have been split between different people according to their skills and preferences. This would improve the productivity and efficiency of the process leading to a better end result.</p>
<p>To improve productivity and efficiency, the developer has to aquire necessary skills (e.g. CSS, HTML, etc.) and experience in applying them.</p>
<p>Next time, while team-working, I would use Slack and GitHub more extensively and professionally.</p>
<p>It is important to test the performance, functionality and appearance of newly built websites by accessing them from different browsers and gadgets. An independent user with a fresher look will be able to provide a valuable feedback on the ways how to improve the quality of the product.User Acceptance Testing should be implemented throughout the entire development workflow, rather than conducted at the end of a software development phase, at a time when the product is nearly “finished”. A more agile approach to UAT offers continuous progress and ensuring continuous test and feedback cycles.</p>
